On his acquisition of The Other Palace theatre in Victoria, Lloyd-Webber added a restaurant, The Other Naughty Piglet, and he and his wife Lady Madeleine Lloyd-Webber completed a £60m-refurbishment of the Theatre Royal Drury Lane to include a luxury café and <a href=#>outdoor terrace.</a>&nbsp;</p><p>And there has never been a better time to <a href=#>plan dinner and a show.</a> Now, although in-theatre dining has got better across the board over the past few years, some might want to make an evening of it - whether you're visiting London's West End or other parts of the city.</p><p>For anyone less familiar with London, we'd hate for you to fall prey to some ubiquitous Italian chain on the way to the show or to end your evening on anything less than a spectacular note. The city has <a href=#>so many great eateries to show you</a> - so use this&nbsp;list for inspiration to&nbsp;seek out&nbsp;the best places to get a reservation in the vicinity of each of the West End’s 38 theatres, as well as some of the popular venues slightly further afield.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-colour">Best for... Theatre Royal Haymarket;&nbsp;Harold Pinter Theatre;&nbsp;Criterion Theatre;&nbsp;Her Majesty's Theatre; Queen's Theatre; Gielgud Theatre; Prince of Wales Theatre; Soho Theatre; Leicester Square Theatre; Apollo Theatre; Sondheim Theatre; Lyric Theatre; Piccadilly Theatre</h2><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour">Brasserie Zedel&nbsp;</h2><p>This spot is ideal for early diners, and even better for late ones, taking orders until 11pm and providing, in the form of the low-lit, sultry Bar Américain, a digestif spot a mere stumble away from the dinner table. You don’t even have to leave the building. This underground French restaurant is well-known as the premiere pre- and post-theatre dining spot.&nbsp;</p><p>Expect top-notch service, late evening live jazz , and a good-value (and&nbsp;particularly appetising)&nbsp;set menu.</p><p>Brasserie Zedel, 20 Sherwood Street, London, W1F 7ED; 020 7734 4888;&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>brasseriezedel.com</a></p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour">Palomar&nbsp;</h2><p>You can walk in, but unless you plan on dining after the show, booking ahead is strongly advised. The Palomar is always busy, and rightly so. The unique brand of Mediterranean-Jewish cuisine comes steeped in tradition, tahini and creative flair.&nbsp;</p><p>Pre-show eaters: leave as much time as you can to eat –&nbsp;not because it’s not fast, but because it’s fantastic. Post-show diners: sit at its notoriously raucous bar counter. With percussion on the pans and arak shots aplenty, it’ll add the perfect finish to a good performance, and the perfect remedy for a bad one.&nbsp;</p><p>The Palomar, 34 Rupert Street, London, W1D 6DN; 020 7439 8777;&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>thepalomar.co.uk</a></p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour">Fallow&nbsp;</h2><p>With its recently-opened (end of 2021) permanent site in central London, Fallow brings with it its classic favourite dishes from the pop-up, as well as a range of new mouth-watering plates. Whether you choose to dine before or after your show, your stomach is sure to be happy with dishes such as cod’s head, Sriracha butter sauce; confit cabbage, black garlic, chestnut and grilled venison with red wine sauce on the menu.</p><p>With all the main menu items available on the pre and post theatre menu, show-goers don't have to worry about missing out by dining from a more limited menu (as can be the case). While the kitchen is open late enough to cater to most shows finishing times, if open to choice, we'd recommend dining before as you'll want to focus on the performance and not how you plan to devour the entire menu afterwards...</p><p>Fallow, 2 St James's, London, SW1Y 4RP;&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>fallowrestaurant.com</a></p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>Fallow's new permanent spot in St James's is the perfect place to eat pre or post theatre show</span></figure><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour">The Seafood Bar&nbsp;</h2><p>All the way from Amsterdam, this family-run seafood restaurant is a dream stop before or after a show for anyone who loves, you guessed it, their seafood. Using the finest quality ingredients and with a menu that focuses on shellfish, due to the eco-friendly ethos of the brand, theatre-goers should focus on ordering the garlic shrimps, clams with white wine and the crab cakes - while the impressive tower that is the restaurant's 'fruits de mer' platter (sometimes combined with a mixed grill to up the ante) gives a healthy meaning to fast food. Salmon and sustainability lovers, pay attention as The Seafood Bar uses only Nordic Blu salmon, which is the world's greenest-farmed salmon.</p><p>The Seafood Bar, 77 Dean St, London W1D 3SH, 020 4525 0733; <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">theseafoodbar.com</a></p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour">NOPI</h2><p>Having just celebrated its tenth year (in October 2021), NOPI by Yotam Ottolenghi is sure to impress when making your dinner plans.

Whichever diners choose, they can feast upon tasty dishes such as the warming Hokkaido milk bun and soft shell crab or the zesty haamachi with truffle soy and furikake. The courgette flower with miso mascarpone is definitely worth trying, as are the seasbass, tuna and venison skewers.

Or is it the fact that they&nbsp;source&nbsp;from small Italian suppliers for their wood-fired Neapolitan pizzas while getting meat and fish from British suppliers?&nbsp;It’s open until 10.30pm, but our advice is&nbsp;pizza pre-theatre, and a sweet rum baba after the show.</p><p>‘O ver, 44-46 Southwark Street, Southwark, London, SE1 1UN; 020 7378 9933;&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>overuk.com</a></p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour">Kubba by Juma</h2><p>Both finer Iraqi cuisine and street food nibbles feature on Phil's menu at KUBBA by Juma Kitchen. One of the more recent additions to Borough Market, this hidden gem is definitely one to star on the map.&nbsp;Serving dishes up in a timely fashion, the must-orders are the dolma (lamb mince-stuffed vine leaves, courgettes, peppers and onion shells); dijaj bilmynarinj (crispy chicken thigh with saffron sauce) and the spicy potatoes.</p><p>KUBBA by Juma, Unit 53, Borough Market Kitchens, Winchester Walk, SE1 9AG;&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>jumakitchen.com</a></p><h2 class="u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-colour">Best for... Royal Court Theatre</h2><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour">Kahani</h2><p>Another theatre but never another average meal. Those craving a spice fix can rest easy knowing that Kahani (just off Sloane Square) will most certainly satisfy. From the grilled scallops with coconut and curry leaves sauce to the classic Tandoor lamb chops, you will be well fed and watered (thanks to spicy mango cocktails) before or after your show.</p><p>Kahani, 1 Wilbraham Pl, London SW1X 9AE; 020 7730 7634;&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">kahanilondon.com</a></p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>Get your Indian food fix before or after the show</span></figure><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour">Royal Court Theatre Bar and Kitchen&nbsp;</h2><p>There’s a lot to recommend this in-house Bar and Kitchen, not least its location within the depths of the decadent 19th century playhouse itself. Being the only independent restaurant in Sloane Square, the food is meticulously sourced - Neal’s Yard Diary, Brindisa and Gressingham play leading roles here - and they are simply and&nbsp;speedily prepared.&nbsp;</p><p>Royal Court Theatre Bar and Kitchen, Sloane Square, London, SW1W 8AS; 020 7565 5058;&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>royalcourtheatre.com</a></p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour">No. Fifty Cheyne</h2><p>Chef Iain Smith runs the show at No. Fifty Cheyne, making the restaurant a Chelsea staple since it reopened in 2019. With seasonal and regional ingredients at the heart of No. Fifty Cheyne's ethos, the menu offers contemporary British cuisine - and stunning views of Chelsea Embankment. Rabbit terrine and roasted scallops have our votes for the starters, while the mains will see you torn between the various grill options (what the restaurant proudly champions). Choose between a range of quality steak cuts, as well as Cornish dover sole and Scottish lobster. There's a selection of classic British desserts too&nbsp;if you have the time - and space. It's a&nbsp;little bit of a walk from the theatre - but who doesn't enjoy walking off their dinner or a good stretch of their legs after a show?&nbsp;</p><p>No. Fifty Cheyne, 50 Cheyne Walk, London SW3 5LR;&nbsp;02073768787;<a href=# rel=nofollow>&nbsp;fiftycheyne.com</a></p><h2 class="u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-colour">Best for... Lyric Hammersmith; Hammersmith Apollo</h2><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour">Cellar at Kindred</h2><p>Sample the menu at the recently-opened (April 2022) Cellar at Kindred - Hammersmith's newest members club. While Kindred requires guests to be members, Cellar is open to the public - so everyone can enjoy the menu designed and implemented by Chef Andrew Clarke. Highlights include the little grilled cheese with leek-topped kimchi and the butterflied mackerel wit green tomato gribiche, but the star of the show has to be the Korean-spiced Dexter beef tartare with straw chips which, quite frankly, was one of the best (and most moreish) London plates have showcased.</p><p>Cellar at Kindred, Bradmore House, Queen Caroline St, London W6 9BW; 020 3146 1370; <a href=# rel=nofollow>wearekindred.com</a></p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>Try out the newly-opened Cellar at Kindred if you're seeing a show in West London</span></figure><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour">La Petite Bretagne&nbsp;</h2><p>A barricade of chain restaurants surround the Lyric Theatre Hammersmith, the breezy plaza sandwiched by Pret, Bill’s, Nando’s and other variants. Yet even if what you’re after is cheap and fast food, you’d be better served by La Petite Bretagne, the creperie on adjacent Beadon road. The founder is French; his flavours are testament to the fact, being reassuringly traditional.&nbsp;</p><p>La Petite Bretagne, 5-7 Beadon Road, Hammersmith, London, W6 0EA; 020 8127 5530;&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>lapetitebretagne.co.uk</a></p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour">The Gate&nbsp;</h2><p>You’ll struggle to make the Lyric without a stitch, but the Apollo’s in stumbling distance, should this paragon of British vegetarianism tick your boxes. The two owners are of Indo-Iraqi-Jewish&nbsp;heritage, and their mouthwatering knowledge of ingredients ripples through the menu, bubbling up in dishes like couscous fritters, butternut rotolo and the ‘green dragon’ salad. Beware the mezze platter, which takes at least 15 minutes' prep. Everything else is fairly pronto.</p><p>The Gate, 51 Queen Caroline Street, Hammersmith, London, W6 9QL; 020 8748 6932;&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>thegaterestaurants.com</a></p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour">Brackenbury Wine Rooms&nbsp;</h2><p>Wine divides&nbsp;theatregoers into several camps: those who lament its dampening of their critical faculties, and those who welcome it. This wine room boasts the considerable merit of having not four, but 40 wines by the glass, and a list of (well sourced) bar snacks to reassure even the driest theatregoer that their chosen selection will find its match on the luxurious accompanying bar snacks menu.</p><p>Brackenbury Wine Rooms, 111-115 Hammersmith Grove, Hammersmith, London, W6 0NQ, 020 3696 8240; <a href=# rel=nofollow>winerooms.london/brackenbury</a></p><h2 class="u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-colour">Best for... Hampstead Theatre</h2><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour">Bradley’s&nbsp;</h2><p>There is only one place to eat in Hampstead Theatre, and that is Bradley’s. This is, officially, Michelin Bib Gourmand-level cooking: the founders and head chefs have won the award plenty&nbsp;of times in the past decade, and with good reason. Their meat and fish is British and seasonal, their approach sustainable, their presentation creative.&nbsp;</p><p>Bradley’s, 25 Winchester Road, Hampstead, London , NW3 3NR; 020 7722 3457;&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>bradleysnw3.co.uk</a></p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour">Jin Kichi</h2><p>One of London's best izakayas, this is the perfect place to eat pre-or post-theatre for those who enjoy good Japanese&nbsp;cuisine - but also like to try something different. While the regular sushi rolls, sashimis and nigiris&nbsp;and robata-grilled dishes make an appearance on the menu, so do chicken gizzard and ox tongue skewers - offering a more interesting and creative take on the food.</p><p>Jin Kichi, 73 Heath Street, London NW3 6UG; 02077946158;&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>jinkichi.com</a></p><h2 class="u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-colour">Best for... The Barbican</h2><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour">Osteria</h2><p>Another in-house restaurant to happily dine at even if theatres and concerts were not mere metres away. Turn up during aperitif hour, when the food is complimentary provided you’ve been to the bar first. Get value for money by turning up in time for a drink before settling down to some seriously well sourced, fresh Italian food.&nbsp;</p><p>Osteria, The Barbican Centre Silk Street, Barbican, London, EC2Y 8DS; 020 7588 3008;&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>osterialondon.co.uk</a></p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour">The Jugged Hare&nbsp;</h2><p>This gastropub is the sort of place in which you wish to hibernate during&nbsp;winter. You can’t, because&nbsp;you’ve a show to go to, but that won’t stop the combination of flavours from instilling comfort and joy deep inside your soul.</p><p>Choose carefully: some cuts of meat will take longer than others, and if there’s one thing that will mar your inner peace, it’s the prospect of dashing off before sampling on head chef’s Stephen Englefield’d jubilantly British approach to food.&nbsp;</p><p>The Jugged Hare, 49 Chiswell Street, Barbican, London, EC1Y 4SA; 020 7614 0134;&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>thejuggedhare.com</a></p><h2 class="u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-colour">Best for... National Theatre; Southbank Centre; Shakespeare’s Globe</h2><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour">Gourmet Pizza Co.</h2><p>There's nothing particularly original about this offering, which is clearly sign-posted by the name. Located on the very edge of the Thames at the heart of the South Bank, pizzas are delicious,&nbsp;salads are fresh and crunchy, and the wine list is surprisingly deep. Ideal for a pre-theatre dinner too, because the service is incredibly quick.&nbsp;</p><p>Gourmet Pizza Co., 56 Upper Ground, London SE1 9PP; 020 7928 3188;&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>gourmetpizzacompany.co.uk</a></p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour">The Green Room</h2><p>Sitting directly behind the National Theatre, the Green Room is aptly named: with a heated courtyard surrounded by the&nbsp;aromatic homegrown herbs which chefs and bartenders use in their food and drink. The menu includes all the basics you'd expect from pizza to fish and chips but beautifully elevated from what you'd get in a standard takeaway.&nbsp;</p><p>The Green Room, 101 Upper Ground, London SE1 9PP; 020 3034 0991;&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>grlondon.co.uk</a></p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour">The Swan at Shakespeare's Globe</h2><p>Given that it's just a&nbsp;bit&nbsp;further away you may find yourself rushing to make it to the Globe if you don't plan well in advance for the above two restaurants, but fear not, there's a brilliant restaurant as part of the theatre complex. The Swan feels like a very sleek, modern take on a classic English gastropub experience. All the groceries are bought fresh daily from the nearby Borough market from British farmers and producers and menus are seasonal. You can enjoy two courses from the theatre menu for £25.50 or three for £28.50 and be right on time for the show.&nbsp;</p><p>The Swan, 21 New Globe Walk, Bankside, London SE1 9DT; 020 7928 9444;&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>swanlondon.co.uk</a></p><p>This guide has been updated with the latest advice and information for winter 2022.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbHLnp6rmaCde6S7ja6iaJ6fpLFurc2dZJ2qmaO4cLLEmquuqpWofKOx0q1kqaqVYr2wv9Nmq6Gdkam%2FpnnDoqWnnaJiubC6w6ilZqqVqMGiwdGapa2rXZbCtcHMp2RraGJnfA%3D%3D</p></content><div></div><section class=sk3-margin-v-full><section class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h"><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><sk3-social><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=%2fthe-best-pre-and-post-theatre-restaurants-to-book-for-dinner-in-london-this-autumn.html&title=The%20best%20pre%20and%20post-theatre%20restaurants%20to%20book%20for%20dinner%20in%20London%20this%20autumn" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"LinkedIn","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#linkedin"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-best-pre-and-post-theatre-restaurants-to-book-for-dinner-in-london-this-autumn.html&description=The%20best%20pre%20and%20post-theatre%20restaurants%20to%20book%20for%20dinner%20in%20London%20this%20autumn" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Pinterest","width=800,height=720,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#pinterest"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-best-pre-and-post-theatre-restaurants-to-book-for-dinner-in-london-this-autumn.html&title=The%20best%20pre%20and%20post-theatre%20restaurants%20to%20book%20for%20dinner%20in%20London%20this%20autumn" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Reddit","width=832,height=624,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#reddit"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//t.me/share/url?url=%2fthe-best-pre-and-post-theatre-restaurants-to-book-for-dinner-in-london-this-autumn.html&title=The%20best%20pre%20and%20post-theatre%20restaurants%20to%20book%20for%20dinner%20in%20London%20this%20autumn" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Telegram","width=800,height=600,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#telegram"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//twitter.com/intent/tweet/?url=%2fthe-best-pre-and-post-theatre-restaurants-to-book-for-dinner-in-london-this-autumn.html&text=The%20best%20pre%20and%20post-theatre%20restaurants%20to%20book%20for%20dinner%20in%20London%20this%20autumn" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Twitter","width=800,height=450,resizable=yes,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#twitter"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//vk.com/share.php?url=%2fthe-best-pre-and-post-theatre-restaurants-to-book-for-dinner-in-london-this-autumn.html" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"VK","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#vk"/></svg></a></sk3-social></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><div class=sk3-margin-h><h3>Reinaldo Massengill</h3></div><div class="sk3-margin-h sk3-margin-down">Update: 2024-08-09</div></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><a class="sk3-margin-h txt-center-h" href=./bayelsa-election-4-reasons-court-may-sack-governor-douye-diri.html><h3>&lt;&lt; Bayelsa Election: 4 Reasons Court May Sack Governor Douye Diri</h3></a><a class="sk3-margin-h txt-center-h" href=./see-will-forte-return-as-macgruber-in-an-interview-from-jail.html><h3>See Will Forte Return As MacGruber In An Interview From Jail >></h3></a></div></div></section></section><div></div></div></div><footer class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h sk3-margin-v-full sk3-pad-v-full"><div class="sk3-pad-h txt-center-h">©
