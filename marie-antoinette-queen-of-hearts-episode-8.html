arms and ammunition?</p><p>Are you absolutely certain?</p><p>You have your spies, we have ours.</p><p>I urge you to speak to your brother, Monsieur.</p><p>It cannot be in either of our interests to go to war, over a bunch of revolutionaries.</p><p>[Maurepas] Ugh.</p><p>When you declare your support for American independence, we must be prepared for England to declare war on us.</p><p>We will have 32 ships of the line, seven frigates, five corvettes and one lugger.</p><p>All ready for battle.</p><p>[Maurepas] Excellent.</p><p>Your Majesty.</p><p>[straining] We must have... naval superiority, in

colonies?</p><p>I am not.</p><p>Don't lie to me.</p><p>I know that ferret face too well.</p><p>Don't speak to me like that.</p><p>Do I need to remind you how fortunate you are to be here after your unforgiveable behaviour?</p><p>It had nothing to do with me.</p><p>She was responsible for the libelle.</p><p>And you were a co-conspirator.</p><p>I am still the heir to your throne.</p><p>Why shouldn't I speak out about matters that concern us as a family?</p><p>-If you slip up we will be... -I won't.</p><p>Why do you go out of your way to make me feel so powerless?</p><p>Because you
